# Community Content - Python

This folder contains content introducing Python and demonstrating how to use it to build rich apps. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Using Python with Visual Studio Code (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
