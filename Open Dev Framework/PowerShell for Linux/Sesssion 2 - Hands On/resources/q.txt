Arthur Quiller-Couch - I Saw Three Ships

In those west-country parishes where but a few years back the feast of 
Christmas Eve was usually prolonged with cake and cider, "crowding," and 
"geese dancing," till the ancient carols ushered in the day, a certain 
languor not seldom pervaded the services of the Church a few hours later. Red 
eyes and heavy, young limbs hardly rested from the Dashing White Sergeant and 
Sir Roger, throats husky from a plurality of causes--all these were 
recognised as proper to the season, and, in fact, of a piece with the holly 
on the communion rails.
