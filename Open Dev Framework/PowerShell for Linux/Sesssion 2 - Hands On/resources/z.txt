Emile Zola - The Fortune of the Rougons

On quitting Plassans by the Rome Gate, on the southern side of the town, you 
will find, on the right side of the road to Nice, and a little way past the 
first suburban houses, a plot of land locally known as the Aire Saint-Mittre.

This Aire Saint-Mittre is of oblong shape and on a level with the footpath of 
the adjacent road, from which it is separated by a strip of trodden grass. A 
narrow blind alley fringed with a row of hovels borders it on the right; 
while on the left, and at the further end, it is closed in by bits of wall 
overgrown with moss, above which can be seen the top branches of the 
mulberry-trees of the Jas-Meiffren--an extensive property with an entrance 
lower down the road. Enclosed upon three sides, the Aire Saint-Mittre leads 
nowhere, and is only crossed by people out for a stroll.
