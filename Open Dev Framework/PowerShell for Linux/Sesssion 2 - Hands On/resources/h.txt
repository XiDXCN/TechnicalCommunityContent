Nathaniel Hawthorne  The House of Seven Gables

The Old Pyncheon Family

Halfway down a by-street of one of our New England towns stands a rusty wooden 
house, with seven acutely peaked gables, facing towards various points of the 
compass, and a huge, clustered chimney in the midst. The street is Pyncheon 
Street; the house is the old Pyncheon House; and an elm-tree, of wide 
circumference, rooted before the door, is familiar to every town-born child by 
the title of the Pyncheon Elm. On my occasional visits to the town aforesaid, 
I seldom failed to turn down Pyncheon Street, for the sake of passing through 
the shadow of these two antiquities, --the great elm-tree and the weather-
beaten edifice.
