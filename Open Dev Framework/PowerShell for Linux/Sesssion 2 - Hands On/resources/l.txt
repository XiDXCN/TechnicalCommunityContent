D. H. Lawrence - Lady Chatterleyâ€™s Lover

Ours is essentially a tragic age, so we refuse to take it tragically. The 
cataclysm has happened, we are among the ruins, we start to build up new little 
habitats, to have new little hopes. It is rather hard work: there is now no 
smooth road into the future: but we go round, or scramble over the obstacles. 
We've got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.
