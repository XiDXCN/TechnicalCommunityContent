Maxim Gorky - The Man Who Was Afraid

About sixty years ago, when fortunes of millions had been made on the Volga with
fairy-tale rapidity, Ignat Gordyeeff, a young fellow, was working as water-
pumper on one of the barges of the wealthy merchant Zayev.

Built like a giant, handsome and not at all stupid, he was one of those people 
whom luck always follows everywhere--not because they are gifted and 
industrious, but rather because, having an enormous stock of energy at their 
command, they cannot stop to think over the choice of means when on their way 
toward their aims, and, excepting their own will, they know no law. Sometimes 
they speak of their conscience with fear, sometimes they really torture 
themselves struggling with it, but conscience is an unconquerable power to the 
faint-hearted only; the strong master it quickly and make it a slave to their 
desires, for they unconsciously feel that, given room and freedom, conscience 
would fracture life. They sacrifice days to it; and if it should happen that 
conscience conquered their souls, they are never wrecked, even in defeat--they 
are just as healthy and strong under its sway as when they lived without 
conscience.
