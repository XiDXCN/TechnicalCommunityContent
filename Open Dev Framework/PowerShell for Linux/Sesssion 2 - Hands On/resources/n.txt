 Kathleen Norris - Mother: A Story

"Well, we couldn't have much worse weather than this for the last week of 
school, could we?" Margaret Paget said in discouragement. She stood at one of 
the school windows, her hands thrust deep in her coat pockets for warmth, her 
eyes following the whirling course of the storm that howled outside. The day 
had commenced with snow, but now, at twelve o'clock, the rain was falling in 
sheets, and the barren schoolhouse yard, and the play-shed roof, ran muddy 
streams of water.
