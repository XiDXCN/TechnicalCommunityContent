Washington Irving - Life of George Washington

The Washington family is of an ancient English stock, the genealogy of which 
has been traced up to the century immediately succeeding the Conquest. At 
that time it was in possession of landed estates and manorial privileges in 
the county of Durham, such as were enjoyed only by those, or their 
descendants, who had come over from Normandy with the Conqueror, or fought 
under his standard. When William the Conqueror laid waste the whole country 
north of the Humber, in punishment of the insurrection of the Northumbrians, 
he apportioned the estates among his followers, and advanced Normans and 
other foreigners to the principal ecclesiastical dignities. One of the most 
wealthy and important sees was that of Durham. Hither had been transported 
the bones of St. Cuthbert from their original shrine at Lindisfarne, when it 
was ravaged by the Danes. That saint, says Camden, was esteemed by princes 
and gentry a titular saint against the Scots.
