# Community Content - Azure IaaS

This folder contains content introducing Azure IaaS and demonstrating how to use it to deploy virtual machines and clusters of virtual machines in the cloud. The content is divided into three sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Working with Azure Virtual Machines (HOL)
- Session 3 - Virtual Machine Scaling and Performance (HOL)

The HOLs may be presented as hands-on labs or as demos accompanying the slide deck.
