IN PROGRESS - Pending slide updates and overall video

# Session 3 - Practical DevOps #
---

The slide deck contains the main presentation and refers to various demos.

You'll find the demo scripts in their respective folders so you can rehearse the demos.  Be sure to checkout the setup requirements in each of the demos at least one day before your presentation.  You may have 30-60 minutes of setup to do.

Be sure to pay attention to the Teardown instructions to make sure you do not receive excessive Azure service charges.

NOTE - For the hands-on lab (HOL 3.1) in this session you'll need to give attendees a download link to these 3 folders of files:

HOL 3.1 - VotingApp Simple Continuous Deployment
HOL 3.2 - VotingApp Full Continuous Integration Deployment
Resources (in the folder above this one)

You may want to zip up the files and put them on your OneDrive (or similar service) and configure for public access.  Ideally, you also provide a shortened link using a service such a http://bit.ly.

NOTE - The hands-on lab(s) in this session can alternatively be done as a demo as part of the session, instead of as a hands-on-lab.
