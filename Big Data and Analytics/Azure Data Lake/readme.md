# Community Content - Azure Data Lake

This folder contains content introducing Azure Data Lake and demonstrating how to use it to aggregate data sources and query them with U-SQL. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Handling Big-Data Workloads with Azure Data Lake (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
