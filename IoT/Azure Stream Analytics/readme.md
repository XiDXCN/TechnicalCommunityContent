# Community Content - Azure Stream Analytics

This folder contains content introducing Azure Stream Analytics and demonstrating how to use it to process real-time data streams emanating from IoT devices and other sources. The content is divided into two sessions:

- Session 1 - Slides
- Session 2 - Analyzing Data in Real Time with Azure Stream Analytics (HOL)

The HOL may be presented as a hands-on lab or as a demo accompanying the slide deck.
